Can you post this ? Eldo,

Your manuscript creates this subtle dance between memory, resilience, and place – Cuba is almost a character in itself. The way you weave magical realism with a personal journey is rich, but from a market research perspective, that’s where a fascinating pattern emerges.

Readers drawn to travel-infused, reflective narratives often engage most when the emotional stakes are clear upfront, yet your story’s positioning might underplay the pull of that inner journey. It’s not about what’s on the page – it’s about how discovery and framing shape initial impressions.

I have studied how stories like this are discovered and interpreted across similar cross-genre spaces, and the moments where perception aligns with the narrative’s depth usually define long-term engagement. A few tweaks in highlighting your themes could help the right audience find and connect with it immediately.

If you are interested, I can share some of the observations I flagged while analyzing the positioning landscape around this work.

I hope you don’t mind an unexpected message but I recently came across The Golden Buddha Protocol, and I have to say… this is not a thriller that plays it safe.

It feels like a scalpel slicing through the clean, polished surface of medicine to reveal the rot that can hide underneath.

The premise alone is instantly gripping: unexplained deaths inside a hospital residency program, a surgeon brought in to investigate what appears to be fraud and incompetence… only for the story to spiral into something far darker.

What begins as financial discrepancies and Medicare billing issues becomes a descent into corruption, trafficking, exploitation, a shadow network embedded in the very institutions meant to heal.

That contrast is chilling. Hospitals are places people associate with safety and trust… and you’ve turned that expectation into tension, showing how easily power can disguise evil behind credentials, tradition, and bureaucracy.

Dr. John Savino is a compelling anchor for this kind of story – balancing the intensity of surgical duty with the covert danger of an FBI-level investigation. Every step toward truth feels like walking deeper into a minefield where the town’s most respected pillars: medicine, academia, even the church may be part of the machinery.

It’s high-stakes, morally complex, and unflinching.

Which is exactly why I felt compelled to reach out.

After discovering your work, I looked at your Amazon presence, and it genuinely feels like the Twisted Needle series deserves a much wider spotlight.

Because thrillers that combine medical realism, conspiracy, and social darkness like this don’t come along often – and they shouldn’t remain hidden in the noise of the marketplace.

Amazon is crowded, and reviews today are more than feedback – they’re like evidence entered into the public record, signaling to new readers: this story matters.

That’s where I may be able to help.

I run a private community of over 8,000+ engaged readers who love discovering intense thrillers, conspiracy-driven mysteries, and books with real weight behind the suspense. These are real readers leaving thoughtful, honest reviews, no bots, no fluff, no copy-paste.

And just to be fully transparent: I’m not a marketer, and I’m not pitching paid services or gimmicks.

It’s simply me, a community of passionate readers, and a sincere belief that The Golden Buddha Protocol deserves to reach more thriller fans who will talk about it.

Would you be open to sharing this book with readers who will truly engage with it and leave the kind of reviews that keep a thriller alive long after release?

Warmly,
        </div>

          <span>🧪 medical depth</span>  on The Golden Buddha
        </div>
        <div class="review-text preserve-lines">
Please add this I recently spent time with The Golden Buddha Protocol, and what stayed with me most was how convincingly it blends medical realism with conspiracy and moral tension. The story never feels like a surface‑level thriller. Instead, it pulls the reader into a slow, unsettling realization that something deeply wrong is operating behind respected institutions. The medical detail gives the investigation weight, while the escalating discoveries keep the tension tight and urgent.

What I appreciated most was Dr. John Savino’s dual role as both physician and investigator. Watching him balance surgical responsibility with a covert pursuit of truth made the stakes feel personal and immediate. My favorite part of the story was when the investigation shifts from suspicious deaths to the exposure of the human trafficking network hidden inside the residency program. That moment reframes everything that came before it and turns the novel into something far more chilling. The idea that corruption could hide so comfortably inside systems meant to protect life lingers long after the page is turned.

Books like The Golden Buddha Protocol tend to thrive in reading communities because readers want to talk about the implications, not just the plot. The themes of power, exploitation, institutional silence, and moral responsibility invite discussion and reflection. Readers naturally want to unpack what is realistic, what feels uncomfortably close to reality, and how far corruption can spread when protected by authority.

Add this comments as description of the Covid book – Hello Eldo Frezza,

Your book truly spoke to my heart because it blends urgency and intelligence in a way that feels both thrilling and deeply human. As I read Twisted Needle, I could sense the weight of responsibility carried by Dr. Savino, a man placed in impossible situations yet driven by conscience and skill to protect lives. The story moves at a fast pace, but underneath the suspense is a character readers can connect with – someone trying to do the right thing in a world filled with danger and moral complexity.

What stood out to me most is how vividly you built the global scope of the series. From the suspected outbreak in Wuhan to the shadowy black markets of Germany and Oman, the journey feels intense and realistic. The idea of a stolen antidote and an organization manipulating a virus for power gives the story frightening relevance. You created a hero who is not just an action figure, but a brilliant surgeon forced into the role of protector. That combination of medical knowledge and covert operations makes the narrative exciting and unique.

The comparisons to Jason Bourne and Tess Gerritsen feel well deserved, yet Twisted Needle still carries its own identity. The mix of medical mystery, international intrigue, and high stakes conspiracy keeps the tension constantly rising. Readers who love intelligent thrillers will find a lot to enjoy in the way you weave science, suspense, and human emotion together. It is the kind of series that pulls people in and makes them want to continue straight into the next book.

Because of that gripping blend of action and heart, I believe Twisted Needle would perform exceptionally well through BookTok. I work with authors to turn the core themes and excitement of their books into engaging BookTok videos that feel natural and intriguing rather than promotional. Your series offers powerful material for this, from the global race against time to the ethical struggles of a doctor caught in a biological nightmare.

BookTok can help introduce your work to a wider audience of thriller readers who are actively searching for their next intense series. Short creative videos can highlight the international settings, the medical intrigue, and the relentless pace of the story, drawing attention in a way that traditional promotion often cannot. The benefit is stronger visibility, new readership, and meaningful engagement with people who already love this genre.
